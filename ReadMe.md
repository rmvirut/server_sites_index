# Info

tl:dr - Lists all the sub-directories in a given folder. Used to list all all the sites/folders I have in my apache www directory for easier navigation from there

This started as an exercise to learn how to work with docker as my default dev environment but I figured I'd create this neat little utility for myself to also learn some more php.

I'll be adding features and making improvements as time goes on.

## Instructions for Use

Simply download the "index.php" file to your server's root directory along with the libs folder and you're all ready to go.

You have the option to use the bootstrap CDN as opposed to a local version ("libs" folder). Update the links in the index.php file's <head> section
